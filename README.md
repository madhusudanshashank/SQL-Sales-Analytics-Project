# SQL Sales Analytics Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL. It involves creating **user-defined functions, stored procedures, and reports** to generate insights from transactional data. The key objectives include:
- Extracting **customer sales data** efficiently.
- Automating fiscal year calculations using **user-defined functions**.
- Generating **gross sales reports** for products and markets.
- Implementing **stored procedures** for reusable analytics.
- Classifying markets based on **total sales performance**.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sales Analysis Using CTEs and Views**
- **Net Sales Calculation**: 
  - Used **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to calculate net invoice sales by applying discounts.
  - Created **views** for both **pre** and **post invoice deductions** to streamline sales calculations.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Top Markets and Customers**
- Created reports to identify the **top 5 markets** by net sales in fiscal year 2021.
- **Stored procedures** to fetch the top N markets and customers dynamically.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Window Functions**
- **Customer-Wise Net Sales Percentage Contribution**:
  - Used window functions to calculate the percentage contribution of each customer to the total net sales.
- **Net Sales Distribution Per Region**:
  - Applied window functions to partition data by region and calculate the share of net sales per region.
- **Top 3 Products Per Division**:
  - Implemented **DENSE_RANK()** to find the top 3 products per division based on total quantity sold in 2021.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Stored Procedures**
- **`get_top_n_markets_by_net_sales`**: Fetches the top N markets by net sales for a given fiscal year.
- **`get_top_n_customers_by_net_sales`**: Fetches the top N customers by net sales for a given market and fiscal year.
- **`get_top_n_products_per_division_by_qty_sold`**: Fetches the top N products by quantity sold in a given fiscal year and division.

## üìä SQL Queries & Explanations

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Analysis Query**

**Objective**: Calculate net sales after applying discounts (pre and post).

üìå How to Use
Set up the database schema: Import the required tables (e.g., fact_sales_monthly, dim_product, fact_gross_price, etc.) into your MySQL database.

Execute SQL scripts:

Run the SQL scripts in the order listed to create tables, views, and stored procedures.

Ensure the views and stored procedures are created correctly.

Run the stored procedures: Use stored procedures to generate dynamic reports.

Example: Run get_top_n_markets_by_net_sales with fiscal year and top N values.

View the output: The results can be seen in your SQL client or exported to Excel for analysis.
